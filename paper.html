paper advocates for an urgent comprehensive growth and fiscal adjustment
program supported by the international donor community to deal with Lebanon’s dangerous
economic and financial crisis while ensuring an equitable burden sharing of the
losses. At the heart of this program, a consolidated balance sheet approach is required
for restructuring the country’s debt (both sovereign and Banque du Liban’s) and
recapitalizing a right-sized banking sector while protecting small depositors. Using
a model-based approach, the scenario analysis argues for taking Lebanon’s debt
to GDP to sustainable levels (60-80% of GDP) over the next 10 years. It stresses
that the debt restructuring strategy should: 1) encompass BDL’s USD
liabilities; 2) design and implement a banks’ recapitalization program that
supports a right-sized and solid banking sector able to finance the growth
recovery; and 3) ensure the cost of bank recapitalization and the burden of
fiscal adjustment are equitably shared through a multipronged socio-economic policy
reform framework. The paper estimates that reducing total debt to these levels
by 2030 would require no less than a 60-70% principal reduction if the
authorities wanted to reduce the extent of an inevitable currency devaluation,
and create the fiscal space to support growth and expand social safety nets. Therein,
the objective should not be to cut primary spending indiscriminately, but
rather to improve its composition and efficiency. The paper warns that inaction
and/or delays by using piecemeal solutions is regressive, exacting bigger
losses on small depositors and the most vulnerable in society.</p><p><i>Note: The numbers presented in
this paper are based on publicly available information as of December 2019 and
estimates (e.g. the banking sector USD deposits at BDL, government arrears and
contingent liabilities, etc.). As such, the analysis that follows could be
subject to material changes should some of this information prove to be
substantially different from what is publicly disclosed (e.g. the foreign
currency liquidity at BDL). The material is used as part of various citizens’
initiatives which aim to engage stakeholders inside and outside Lebanon in
order to shape the priorities and direction of future economic reforms while
stressing the importance of an evidence-based policy framework for dealing with
the crisis. The authors welcome any comments and suggestions for improvements as
the objective of this paper is to help raise awareness about Lebanon’s multifaceted
crisis and contribute to the public debate. They also recognize that some aspects
of the analysis need further study notably in terms of the legal and regulatory
feasibility of some proposals.</i></p><div id="toc_container"><p class="toc_title">Contents</p><ul class="toc_list"><li><a href="#toc1">Introduction</a></li><li><a href="#toc2">I- How did we get here?

dangerous multifaceted crisis: an economic, financial, and socio-political one.
Excessive fiscal and external imbalances, financed through debt for decades under
a fixed exchange rate regime, weakened the balance sheets of the sovereign, banks
and the central bank, and led to a sudden stop of capital that precipitated a
debt, banking and currency crisis.</p><p>This paper recognizes that the
root causes of Lebanon’s unfolding crisis lie in its political system and
political economy, and that any exit strategy would require first and foremost
a genuine political will to reform. With this in mind, the objective is to analyse
the key drivers leading to this crisis, and, building on experiences from other
“crisis countries”, highlight possible scenarios for achieving an orderly
restructuring. Section 1 provides a quick snapshot of the current situation and
how we got here. Section 2 highlights what happened in other “crises countries"
drawing conclusions for a more complicated situation in Lebanon. Section 3
outlines scenarios of debt restructuring and balance sheet repair and argues
for a comprehensive reform plan to anchor the restructuring process and ensure
an equitable burden sharing of the losses. Section 4 concludes.</p><h2 id="toc2">I- How did we get here?
A snapshot of the current situation</h2><p><b>Lebanon has been living above
its means for decades.</b> Since 1992, the country has been running large
current account (CA) deficits (averaging 18% of GDP per annum from 2002-2018)
which widened significantly following the start of the Syrian uprising in 2011 (Figure
1). Compared to other countries that faced similar types of problems, Lebanon
stands out as having one of the worst CA deficits at the start of the crisis (Figure
3). Throughout the period 2002-2018, the cumulative CA deficit reached 20% of cumulative
GDP: current receipts from goods and services exports and remittances inflows from
Lebanese expatriates were outweighed by imports of goods and services, and
constant outflows of remittances from foreign workers (Figure 4). The sharp
drop in the oil price in 2015 squeezed net remittances further exacerbating the
imbalances, as the majority of Lebanese expatriates reside in the Gulf Cooperation
Council Countries (GCC) and African commodity exporters, subject to oil and
commodity price risks (Figure 5). The decision of maintaining the peg since 1997,
even when competitiveness was being eroded, contributed to persistent large
external imbalances.</p><div class="figdiv"><div class="d-flex flex-lg-nowrap flex-xl-nowrap flex-wrap"><figure class="figure w-100"><figcaption># 1. Current account deficit ($bn and % of GDP)</figcaption><a data-footer="<p class=&#34;text-muted small&#34;>Source:

mainly financed by debt creating flows</b>. Since the early nineties, Lebanon
relied extensively on external borrowing and on attracting Non-Residents<sup><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[1]</a></sup> (NR) deposit
inflows (including deposits of the Lebanese diaspora) to fund its large CA
deficits. These debt-creating flows covered 68% of the cumulative CA deficits
during the period 2002-18 (Figure 6) and saw their share increase overtime at
the expense of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows. The latter’s share declined
rapidly since 2007 largely reflecting unfavourable macro-economic conditions
and a deteriorating business environment (Figure 7). Higher interest rates paid
to attract the NR deposit base, inflated the net income transfers abroad,
compounding a widening CA deficit. Most of these flows did not help fund
infrastructure or income generating development projects, but rather went to
finance high levels of state capture as well as rentier type of private sector
activities (Figure 23).</p><div class="figdiv"><div class="d-flex flex-lg-nowrap flex-xl-nowrap flex-wrap"><figure class="figure w-100"><figcaption># 6.

Liban, authors’ analysis.</p></div><p><b>Loose fiscal discipline,
increased budget rigidity and an eroding revenue base exacerbated fiscal
imbalances</b>. Lebanon’s headline fiscal deficits averaged 9.5% of GDP since
2002. Limited progress on fiscal reforms over the past 15 years resulted in a
rigid spending structure with more than 30% of total expenditures absorbed by
interest payments and more than 30% by personnel costs including wages,
pensions and benefits (Figure 8 and 9). Weak fiscal institutions, and absence
of any debt management strategy exacerbated deficits and indebtedness. A badly
designed public sector wage increase which was more expensive than originally anticipated,
brought wages to 12-13% of GDP, while interest payments accounted for about 10%
of GDP. Tax revenues remain low (15% of GDP) compared to 19% of GDP in emerging
markets. Lebanon’s fiscal deficit at more than 11% of GDP in 2019, is wider
than other countries at the onset of their crisis (Figure 10) such as Greece or
Egypt, implying a much more difficult path of fiscal adjustment ahead.</p><div class="figdiv"><div class="d-flex flex-lg-nowrap flex-xl-nowrap flex-wrap"><figure class="figure w-100"><figcaption># 8.

Banque du Liban, authors’ analysis.</p></div><p><b>That is not to say that the
solution is in cutting spending indiscriminately.</b> While personnel costs to
GDP (wages and salaries and social contributions) is amongst the highest in emerging
markets and points to the need of public sector restructuring, Lebanon’s
primary expenditures (i.e. total expenditures excluding interest, 21% of GDP in
2018) is not out of line with other Emerging Markets countries (EM average 26%
of GDP). If at all, Lebanon is one of the highest spenders on education and
health in the world, yet with poor outcomes as measured by key human
development indicators (PISA scores, HDI, etc.) underscores the need to
improve spending composition and efficiency and not only focus on
indiscriminate austerity measures, notably by enacting reform of public
procurement.</p><p><b>Those unsustainable twin
deficits led to a rapid build-up of public and external debt.</b> Debt to GDP
rose from a mere 52% of GDP in 1992 to nearly 175% of GDP by the end of 2019
(Figure 11) – one of the highest in the world (Figure 12). It is higher than
the debt level of Greece at the onset of its financial troubles (103% of GDP in
2007; Figure 13) ushering that the unfolding adjustment in Lebanon is likely to
be more difficult than in Greece. In parallel, external debt (i.e. foreign currency
denominated debt) reached 191 % of GDP by the end of 2018 largely driven by rampant
foreign liabilities of the banking system, including increases in non-resident
deposits.</p><div class="figdiv"><div class="d-flex flex-lg-nowrap flex-xl-nowrap flex-wrap"><figure class="figure w-100"><figcaption># 11.

deteriorated, local banks reduced their exposure to the sovereign, while BDL
monetized large and persistent fiscal deficits and debt</b>. External
shocks compounded by weak governance, lack of reforms and costly financial
engineering operations led to a rapid deterioration in the sovereign and banking
sectors’ balance sheets, precipitating an erosion of confidence and a sudden
stop of capital. As Lebanon’s access to capital markets became impossible, the
share of LBP denominated debt expanded, and notably the share held by BDL:
almost 98% of the incremental government debt came directly from the BDL during
the last 5 years (Figure 17). Its share in total debt thus reached more than 40%
at end of 2019, up from around 20% at the end of 2014; while BDL’s share in total
LBP debt rose from 32% to 58% respectively during the same period (Figure 16).</p><div class="figdiv"><div class="d-flex flex-lg-nowrap flex-xl-nowrap flex-wrap"><figure class="figure w-100"><figcaption># 14.

model relied on high interest rates to attract deposits, expanding the deposit base,

deposit base reached a peak of 309% of GDP in 2016 (Figures 18 and 19). It was largely
motivated by attractive spreads on $ deposits (onshore vs offshore) (Figure 21).
These spreads rose sharply since mid-2016 (exceeding 4.5%) as the liquidity
crunch exacerbated given the dwindling inflows, and as BDL’s financial
engineering operations expanded. The latter aimed at bringing fresh $deposits
into the banking sector, channelling them into deposits at BDL by offering
higher marginal interest rates which gradually led to disintermediation and
increased financial repression. This translated into higher LBP lending rates, that
stifled growth and pushed Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) higher.</p><div class="figdiv"><div class="d-flex flex-lg-nowrap flex-xl-nowrap flex-wrap"><figure class="figure w-100"><figcaption># 18.

to BDL inflated the latter’s balance sheet significantly since 2016. </b>The
financial engineering operations raised the banks’ exposure to BDL considerably
and expanded its balance sheet (Figure 26). At the end of December 2019, about
60% of banks’ risk assets were placed at BDL compared to 38% in 2003 and 44% at
end 2015 (Figure 24). The operations provided high marginal returns in LBP and
in USD on new bank USD deposits at BDL<sup><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[2]</a></sup>,
and boosted BDL’s dollar holdings. The interest earned from banks’ deposits at
BDL is estimated to have reached $8 bn to $10 bn in 2018, and inflated paper
profits of banks in an otherwise depressed economy. The combined exposure to
BDL and government reached thus 75% of total asset, much higher than in other
countries (Figure 25). The large deposit base allowed banks to channel up to
25% of the assets (circa $50bn or approximately 96% of GDP) to private sector
credits, the majority of which were granted to projects in real estate (40%), trade
financing (23%) and consumer loans (12%) (Figure 23).</p><div class="figdiv"><div class="d-flex flex-lg-nowrap flex-xl-nowrap flex-wrap"><figure class="figure w-100"><figcaption># 26.

position continued to deteriorate and has become one major source of
vulnerability, endangering the stability of the banking and monetary system</b>.
The increasing use of costly financial engineering operations to fund
unsustainable twin deficits over the past few years exacerbated the losses,
particularly since 2016, and left a lasting damage on BDL’s balance sheet. Part
of the banks’ USD deposits were used to fund the government deficit directly
(e.g. through the purchase of Eurobonds and provision of overdraft to the
Treasury in USD) or indirectly. Against an estimated $51 bn of foreign currency
denominated assets ($37 bn excluding gold), the BDL owes the banks an estimated
$80 bn in USD, putting the net negative FX position of the BDL at around $29 bn
($43 bn excluding gold), or approximately 60% of Lebanon’s GDP (Figure 30). The
average interest rate that BDL needs to service these USD deposits averages
4-5% (as of September 2019), which amounts to an annual interest accrued of
around $3 to $4 bn; and highlights the urgency for dealing with losses. This
assumes that the reported foreign currency assets are not encumbered, a claim
we cannot ascertain, especially that some local media reports hinted at the
fact that BDL’s current available foreign currency liquidity may be less than
$31 bn on account of loans from BDL to some banks.</p><div class="figdiv"><figure><figcaption>#30. BDL net foreign currency position ($ bn)- January 2020</figcaption><a data-footer="<p class=&#34;text-muted small&#34;>Source:

currency overvaluation. The appreciation of the Real Effective Exchange rate
(REER) has accelerated since 2015/16 and severely undermined (along with other
factors) the competitiveness of the Lebanese economy. In its latest report, the
IMF estimated the extent of overvaluation at more than 66% as reflected in
increasing REER. While the depreciation of the LBP in the parallel market has
caught up with potential fair valuations, there is no comprehensive approach to
tackling Lebanon’s macro-structural imbalances, which will continue to exert

Lebanon Inc’s net foreign currency position is negative around $48bn,
equivalent to ~90% of GDP. </b>We define Lebanon Inc as the merged /
consolidated entity that encompasses the main three actors in the Lebanese
economy (i.e. the Lebanese Government, BDL and the Lebanese banking sector). As
explained above, the entanglement among the balance sheets of the sovereign,
BDL and that of banks has increased overtime both in terms of size and complexity.
This was largely due to the financial engineering operations that began since
2015/16. We tried to disentangle these debtor/creditor relationships in order
to understand the net foreign currency position of each of the entities both on
a stand-alone and consolidated basis. Figure 34 highlights that both the
sovereign and BDL have net negative foreign currency positions of $30 bn and
$32 bn respectively (this excludes the value of state assets in foreign
currency such as telecoms and MEA). On the other hand, the banks’ foreign
currency assets still exceed their foreign currency liabilities (excluding any
potential loans from BDL to the banks which could range between $7 and $13 bn).
Accordingly, consolidated Lebanon Inc has a net negative foreign currency

estimate, annual external financing needs in 2020-22 averages around $7bn per
year despite a major contraction in the country’s CA deficit (from $26% of GDP
in 2018 to around 15-16% in 2020 we estimate). Assuming payment of FX denominated
debt maturities are made, this along with the CA deficit in 2020 could take BDL’s
gross foreign currency from $31bn<sup><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[3]</a></sup>
at end 2019 closer to $20 bn by year-end and widen Lebanon Inc’s negative
position to at least $55 bn or more than 120% of GDP (Figure 51). Failure to
take measures to stop the drain on thin USD liquidity at BDL will deepen the
insolvency problem at the level of BDL and banks’ balance sheets and increases
the risk of a disorderly currency devaluation with serious social and political
ramifications.</p><h2 id="toc3">II- Lessons from other
“crisis countries”: Where is Lebanon heading?</h2><p><b>The unfolding
crisis is multifaceted encompassing a currency, debt, and banking crisis.</b> Stylized
facts and experiences from other “crisis countries” could shed light on what awaits
Lebanon in terms of economic deterioration and societal tensions in the coming
months and years. Looking at these countries, we can conclude that they faced
simultaneously the following (among others):</p><ul><li>A sharp fall in their level of economic
activity in real and nominal terms;</li><li>A large reduction in their government
revenues (in-line with the fall of nominal GDP);</li><li>A rapid increase in banks non-performing loans;</li><li>A substantial drop in banks’ deposits;</li><li>A rise in the level of unemployment.</li></ul><p>The section
below attempts, by depicting comparisons and benchmarking with some “crisis
countries”, to derive assumptions for the modelling exercise presented in
section 3, while taking into consideration the peculiarity of the socio-political
landscape in Lebanon.</p><p><b>Based on the experience of
other “crisis countries”, a severe cumulative contraction in Lebanon’s real GDP
is inevitable, most likely to the tune of 20-25% over the next five years.</b>
Among the “crisis countries” analysed below, we note that the four largest <i>cumulative</i>
contractions in real GDP took place in Greece and the Baltic countries (Latvia,
Estonia, Lithuania) (Figure 35). As shown in Figure 13, Greece had the largest
stock of government debt relative to GDP at the beginning of its crisis. In
addition, Figure 3 highlights that the Baltic countries experienced some of the
widest current account deficits that led to a severe external adjustment.
Lebanon, hit by a sudden stop of capital inflow, a still large CA deficit and
huge debt overhang, is likely to witness a <i>cumulative</i> real GDP
contraction of similar magnitude as capital inflows fall sharply and quickly
dry up. Recent indicators highlight a major contraction in imports, almost 200 thousand
job losses and many companies paying half salaries as discussed below.</p><div class="figdiv"><div class="d-flex flex-lg-nowrap flex-xl-nowrap flex-wrap"><figure class="figure w-100"><figcaption># 35.

recovery speed in these “crisis countries” typically depends on policymakers’
actions, and notably the credibility of structural reforms and the depth of
debt restructuring</b>. While the recovery in the Baltic countries was fast
(Figure 36), it was driven by i) the low stock of government debt at the start
of the crisis (~0-15% of GDP) which allowed the government to intervene and
expand its balance sheet to support the economy; and ii) the strong foreign
ownership of local banks (foreign banks held a market share in excess of 65%)
which supported their local subsidiaries, allowing the financial sector to
remain stable. Unfortunately, Lebanon cannot currently benefit from similar
drivers which could lead to a prolonged period of distress before the recovery
happens. A nominal contraction of GDP will also ensue as presented in Figures 37,
pushing government debt to GDP up even further.</p><div class="figdiv"><div class="d-flex flex-lg-nowrap flex-xl-nowrap flex-wrap"><figure class="figure w-100"><figcaption># 37.

revenues will thus drop sharply, exacerbating fiscal imbalances. </b>Experience
in other crisis countries suggests a contraction of 25-35%. The large <i>cumulative</i>
contraction in real and nominal GDPwill lead to a severe <i>cumulative</i>
fall in government revenues as witnessed in all countries that underwent a
financial crisis (Figure 39). However, it is worthy to note that the sharpest
fall in government revenues was witnessed in Iceland and Cyprus, two countries
which had some of the largest banking sectors relative to GDP at the start of
their crisis (Figure 20), and where the sector was a major contributor to
economic activity, employment and fiscal revenues. In Lebanon, the financial
sector’s share of GDP hovers around 9% while it employs around 50 thousand
people and contributes about 12% of total revenues to the Treasury. As such,
the deepening of the banking crisis in Lebanon could severely impact its
government revenues immediately.</p><div class="figdiv"><div class="d-flex flex-lg-nowrap flex-xl-nowrap flex-wrap"><figure class="figure w-100"><figcaption># 39.

witnessed in other “crisis countries”, a potential increase of 10 to 20
percentage points over the next few years.</b> The depth of the economic and
financial crisis leading to severe GDP contraction also translated in massive
job destruction (Figure 41). While in Greece fiscal austerity drove much of the
impact on the real economy; in other countries, the banking crisis had also
devastating effects on companies. For example, corporate bankruptcies in
Iceland increased by more than 50% in the first year of the banking crisis,
partly driven by the high currency mismatch between corporate loans and
revenues. In Lebanon, the loss of jobs is already happening and accelerating.
According to Infopro, more than 220 thousand jobs have been shed, while
thousands more employees are being paid half salaries in the private sector.
Lebanon’s unemployment rate, which stood at 11.4% (23.3% for the youth)
according to the latest survey of the CAS, could thus rise further, notably
among youth. Lebanon however may witness a new large wave of emigration that
could dampen the rapid increase in youth unemployment. Besides its
socio-political implications, the likely loss of skilled labour and talent will
have significant ramification on the long-term potential growth of the country.
As such, expanding a properly targeted social safety net over the next few years
will be critical to mitigate the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable.
The macro-economic scenarios discussed in section 3 assume for that matter an
increase in spending on a social safety net of no less than 1.5 percentage
point of GDP.</p><div class="figdiv"><div class="d-flex flex-lg-nowrap flex-xl-nowrap flex-wrap"><figure class="figure w-100"><figcaption># 41. Cumulative percent point change in unemployment</figcaption><a data-footer="<p class=&#34;text-muted small&#34;>Source: IMF, World Bank, national

experiencing a banking crisis saw a huge impact on the financial sector’s
balance sheet as non-performing loans rose by 20 percentage points </b>(Figure
43). In the case of Lebanon, NPLs stood at around 14% at end September (last
available data), but we think this ratio has increased significantly over the
past few months. Having said that, the de-facto capital controls imposed and
inability to withdraw cash out of the banks has led many to repay loans using
existing deposits, which caused the banking sector’s loan books to shrink by around
10% between the end of September and December. Another reason why the increase
in NPLs in Lebanon may not be as high is related to the nature of the
collaterals with approximately 40% of private sector loans collateralized by
real estate and approximately 10% collateralized by cash. The banking sector’s
recovery speed depends on the willingness to quickly absorb the losses from
non-performing loans and recapitalize the banks, as well as the sovereign’s
ability to help. As we discuss below, the ability of the banks to absorb large
NPL losses will be limited by the amount of potential losses on sovereign debt
and BDL exposure. Moreover, the ability of the sovereign (including BDL) to
shoulder a recapitalization is almost non-existent.</p><div class="figdiv"><div class="d-flex flex-lg-nowrap flex-xl-nowrap flex-wrap"><figure class="figure w-100"><figcaption># 43.

confidence. Should the asset base of the banking sector shrink by a third as
suggested below (Figure 45), this will have significant implications on the
structure of the Lebanese economy, including employment and government
revenues. While official capital controls could be a temporary fix, they need
to be transparent, strictly enforceable and accompanied by swift reform
measures to address the root cause of the crisis. Unfortunately, the informal
and discretionary nature of the capital controls currently in place in Lebanon
will only add to the problem by further eroding confidence and intensifying
social tensions.</p><div class="figdiv"><div class="d-flex flex-lg-nowrap flex-xl-nowrap flex-wrap"><figure class="figure w-100"><figcaption># 45. Cumulative contraction of banks’ deposits in $ terms</figcaption><a data-footer="<p class=&#34;text-muted small&#34;>Source: IMF, World Bank,

governments presented and adopted relatively solid frameworks and roadmaps
which were largely debated within their societies and democratic institutions
and put forward by highly competent and professional teams at the level of
ministries of finance, economy and the national central banks. In the case of
Lebanon, most of these elements are still lacking, and notably a professional
and experienced team of policymakers able to engage with both local and international
stakeholders in order to manage the crisis and develop the required solutions.
Moreover, internal political infighting and geopolitical considerations could
complicate the crisis and its resolution process.</p><p><b>On the other hand, Venezuela
presents a live example of a country where the cost of inaction was socially
and economically exorbitant.</b> Venezuela has long been dependent on oil
revenues. The decline of oil prices, the lax macro-fiscal policies under the
Chavez and Maduro governments, US sanctions, a combination of economic
mismanagement and corruption at the top and resorting to printing money to fund
higher spending, notably social, have contributed to Venezuela’s economic
collapse. As shown below, cumulative real GDP contraction reached 54% since
2014 (Figure 47) taking unemployment in 5 years from 7% to 44% by 2019 (Figure
48); while continued monetization of the deficit resulted in hyperinflation
(Figure 49), bringing the share of households with income below national
poverty line to 90% in 2019, up from 48% at the onset of the crisis (Figure 50).</p><div class="figdiv"><div class="d-flex flex-lg-nowrap flex-xl-nowrap flex-wrap"><figure class="figure w-100"><figcaption># 47.

delayed reforms in Lebanon, could see reserve depletion by 2022, and lead to a
prolonged recession with severe socio-economic consequences. </b>In a scenario
of no action, Lebanon Inc’s net negative foreign currency position deteriorates
significantly with time. We have outlined below (Figure 51) some of the costs and
consequences of inaction including continued monetisation of the deficit,
higher inflation and further weakening of growth. The biggest deterioration will
take place in BDL’s foreign currencies reserves which could be depleted before
the end of 2022 <u>assuming a starting base of $31 bn at end 2019</u>, the
persistence of large CA deficit, capital outflows and absence of large external
funding. This may be too optimistic, especially if unencumbered USD liquidity
at BDL is much lower than reported and that reserves’ depletion will likely be
exponential as opposed to linear. In that case, we would expect Lebanon to run
out of reserves by end of 2020-early 2021.</p><div class="figdiv"><figure><figcaption>#51. The cost of inaction is high*</figcaption><a data-footer="<p class=&#34;text-muted small&#34;>Source: IMF,

*BDL data as of 31-Jan-2020. Banking sector data as of Dec-2019.</p></div><p>Based on our
estimates, delays in addressing the net foreign currency position of Lebanon
Inc will worsen if no policy measures are taken, for two key reasons<sup><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[4]</a></sup>:</p><ol type="1"><li>The <b>current account deficit</b> (excluding interest payments)
is estimated to require around $5 bn in 2020 despite it having shrunk
significantly, and $3 bn in the subsequent years.</li><li>The Ministry of Finance needs to pay on average over the next 3
years $1.7 bn of interest and $2.2 bn of principal on foreign currency
denominated debt (i.e. Eurobonds). It is estimated that approximately one third
of these will go to non-resident holders of the Eurobonds implying an average
leakage of $1.3 bn per annum from BDL’s foreign currency reserves.</li><li><b>Capital outflows</b> are estimated to be around $5 bn in 2020
and $3 bn in the subsequent years assuming a proper stringent regulation on
capital controls is enacted by June 2020.</li></ol><p>Given the sudden stop of capital inflows
and the continued depletion of BDL’s gross FX reserves, Lebanon cannot escape a
comprehensive liability management, through restructuring much of this foreign
currency denominated debt at the level of the sovereign and the BDL. A thorough
assessment of the implications on the banks’ balance sheets will thus be
necessary as will be discussed in the next section.</p><h2 id="toc4">III- The need to act: Towards a
sustainable recovery and equitable burden sharing</h2><p><b>Putting the Lebanese economy
on a sustainable recovery path will require a comprehensive approach to address
the crisis and exceptional efforts to restore the confidence of the domestic
and international communities in the economy and its institutions. </b>This
paper is not meant to provide all the detailed elements of a comprehensive
program<sup><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[5]</a></sup>,
but argues instead that the government and BDL will need to act at two levels
and in parallel as soon as possible:</p><ol type="i"><li><b><i>stop the bleeding</i></b> through 1) enforcing
a transparent and non-discretionary legislation on capital controls; 2) a
strategic management of remaining FX liquidity at the BDL; and 3) a
mobilization of external (if possible concessional) emergency liquidity to
support private sector economic activity and expand social safety nets;</li><li><b><i>implement a comprehensive macro-fiscal, growth
recovery and social cohesion plan</i></b> which directly addresses public debt
restructuring, rebuilding a positive BDL net FX reserve position and banks
recapitalization while protecting small depositors. This should go along with a
social rescue plan that expands social safety nets and reforms the pension
system. Accelerating governance and institutional reforms is also necessary to
improve the business environment, strengthen accountability, and ensure a
meritocratic civil service in charge of managing the crisis and public affairs
more generally.</li></ol><p><b>The paper advocates a
comprehensive consolidated balance sheet approach when dealing with Lebanon’s total
stock of debt.</b> It argues that any restructuring of public debt should
encompass BDL’s liabilities and accordingly should provide the basis upon which
banks’ recapitalization is designed and implemented. By presenting various
scenarios using model-based approach, the analysis outlines the assumptions
about the path of policy variables necessary to take Lebanon’s debt to GDP to
sustainable levels (60-80% of GDP) over the next 10 years through a
multipronged policy reform framework discussed below.</p><p>We would note that the numbers
presented in this section are based on publicly available information and
estimates as at December 2019 (e.g. the banking sector USD deposits at BDL,
government arrears, distribution of deposits…). As such, the analysis that
follows could be subject to material changes should some of this information
prove to be substantially different from what is publicly disclosed (e.g. the
foreign currency liquidity at BDL).</p><h3 id="toc5">A- Confirming the net foreign currency position of Lebanon
Inc.</h3><p><b>At the onset, it is critical
to confirm the magnitude of Lebanon Inc’s net negative foreign currency
position through a professional and independent audit. </b>The entanglement
among the balance sheets of the sovereign, BDL and banks has increased overtime
both in terms of size and complexity. Any restructuring solution that only
reduces intra Lebanon Inc’s liabilities (i.e. between the Government, BDL and banks)
without reducing Lebanon Inc’s consolidated liabilities to third parties would not
solve the core problem and could only aggravate and delay the inevitable
adjustment. As shown in Figure 34 above, Lebanon Inc’s net foreign currency
position is estimated to be negative, bn -48bn or almost ~90% of GDP by end
December 2019. It is thus extremely important that the new government
establishes a comprehensive independent audit of the sovereign, BDL and banks’
balance sheets and acknowledges their net position in both local and foreign
currencies.</p><h3 id="toc6">B- Assessing the risk exposure of the banking sector</h3><p><b>The
Lebanese banking sector is exposed to three major credit risks: BDL risk, government
risk and private sector risk</b>.As the economy goes deeper into the
recession undermining banks’ asset quality, a potential restructuring of
sovereign and BDL’s debt held by banks will have a material impact on their balance
sheets as explained in Figure 52 below. These multiple concomitant shocks will
require a momentous effort to recapitalize a right-sized banking sector and
protect depositors, notably the smaller ones.</p><ul><li><b><i>Loans
to the private sector:</i></b> The exposure of the Lebanese banks to the
private sector as of December 2019 amounts to $50bn (of which $34 bn in USD and
$16 bn in LBP). Experience in other “crisis countries” (Figure 43) suggests
incremental losses of 20 percentage points on private sector loans over a
period of two to nine years depending on the depth of the crisis. Assuming
further reductions in loans as borrowers rush to offset loans with trapped
deposits, we applied a relatively limited increase of 15% in NPLs (i.e. an
increase from 14% at the end of September 2019 to 29% at peak) leading to an
incremental loss of $7 to $9bn on the banks’ private sector loan portfolio.
This is in line with a recent IMF study on the dynamics of NPLs during 88 banking
crises since 1990, which suggests a median peak of NPLs relative to the level at
the start of the crisis of 1.8x and an average of 2.9x (Figure 53 and 54). If
we assume an increase of 30% in NPLs (instead of 15%), the incremental losses
for the banking sector will amount to $14-$16bn<sup><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[6]</a></sup>. Our analysis
doesn’t account for the recent circular issued by BDL waiving IFRS9
implementation, as any recapitalization of the banking sector should be done
based on international standards in order to restore confidence in the banks
and maximize their ability to attract foreign capital.</li></ul><ul><li><b><i>Government
debt:</i></b> While banks have significantly reduced their government exposure,
they still hold about 36% of total sovereign debt, $14 bn in USD (Eurobonds)
and the equivalent of $16 bn in LBP (T-Bills/Bonds) (Figure14). As the
sovereign creditworthiness deteriorates, and the government’s ability to repay diminishes,
the cost of servicing this debt rises further. Lebanese officials have been
discussing possibilities for debt re-profiling. Below, we model 5 different
scenarios for the restructuring of government’s debt: scenarios 1 to 3 do not
deal with BDL’s negative FX position while scenarios 4A and 4B address this large
negative gap. The banks losses from government debt restructuring could reach
up to $15bn.</li></ul><ul><li><b><i>Deposits at the Central Bank:</i></b> Local banks have
increased their exposure to the BDL against lucrative returns as explained
above (Figure 23 and 24), helping the BDL shore its gross FX reserves using depositors’
money. At the end of December 2019, banks’ asset at BDL were estimated at
around $119 bn or 60% of total. As seen in Figure 30, BDL’s net foreign currency
position is estimated to be negative at $28.8 bn (including gold) or approximately
60% of GDP, assuming its available foreign currency assets are unencumbered.
The losses to the banks from adjusting BDL’s net negative position could reach
up to $33bn depending on the approach adopted as explained below.</li></ul><div class="figdiv"><figure class="figure w-100"><figcaption>#52.

socially just restructuring</h3><p><b>Creating the needed fiscal space to support growth and expand
social safety nets will require a reduction in the public debt stock at the
onset of the adjustment process. </b>As highlighted in Figure 8, interest
payments account for 10% of GDP, or more than a third of total spending.
Containing the fiscal deficit and ensuring a sustainable debt profile will thus
require a significant reduction in the stock of debt. For that purpose, we
model different possible scenarios for debt restructuring. We highlight below
some key underlying economic assumptions used in the model.These
assumptionsbuild on country experiences analysed in section 2, while
adapting it to Lebanon’s specific context based on available data, with the aim
of improving revenues and increasing spending efficiency in a way that supports
growth and preserves social stability. In particular, the model assumes:</p><ul><li><b>Real GDP</b> contraction of ~20% to 30%
cumulative over the next 5 years (starting in 2019). This is in line with the
impact witnessed in other “crisis” economies (Figure 35) and factors in the
recessionary effects of capital controls, currency devaluation and liquidity
crunch increasingly confirmed by reported bankruptcies and job losses.</li><li><b>Exchange rate</b> is devalued upon
restructuring and settles at 2,600 based on the IMF’s assessment of LBP
overvaluation (Figure 31).</li></ul><p>On <b>the fiscal front</b>, the
policy stance aims at raising revenues and improving the quality and efficiency
of public spending to support growth and social cohesion. As such, the model
assumes the following:</p><ul><li><b>Government primary spending is likely to
remain constant relative to GDP<i>. </i></b>Lebanon’s
primary expenditures averaged 21.2% over the past ten years, compared to 26.6%
in Emerging Markets. The need is therefore not for reducing the level of
spending but rather improving its efficiency and composition, notably through
the following:</li><ul><li><b>Transfers
to EDL</b> are projected to be reduced gradually as energy reforms move forward
and are eliminated in 5 years.</li><li><b>Real
value of public sector wages</b> is partially preserved by 75% increases in nominal
wage in 2020 (the year the exchange rate is devalued), effectively cutting
public wages by 40% in real terms in parallel with major efforts to restructure
state institutions and State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and reforming the civil
service to strengthen accountability<sup><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[7]</a></sup>.</li><li><b>Social
safety nets</b> <b>expansion in the medium-term</b> of ~1.5% of GDP per year over
next 5 years.</li><li><b>Capital
expenditures</b> are projected to initially shrink as government revenues
collapse. We grow capex again in 3 years (2022) relative to 2019 in both
absolute terms and relative to GDP.</li></ul></ul><ul><li><b>Government revenues</b> are expected to
shrink in absolute terms and relative to GDP, and possibly outweigh the contraction
in GDP as they depend on the banking sector, trade (customs duty) and
consumption (VAT), all of which will sharply drop during a recession. However,
fiscal reforms will target raising revenues while strengthening an equitable
wealth redistributing tax system. <u>Under scenarios 1 to 3</u>, we project
government revenues to improve to 22% of GDP closing half of the gap vs. EM
countries <i><u>tax</u></i> revenues (% of GDP). <u>Under scenario 4A-4B</u>,
we project government revenues to improve to 24% in 10 years closing the gap vs.
EM countries <i><u>tax</u></i> revenues (% of GDP).</li></ul><p>On <b>the external front</b>, we estimate the current
account (CA) deficit to shrink from $12bn to around $5- bn in 2020-21 as severe
contraction in economic activity, the sudden stop of capital inflow and the
banking crisis are already causing a massive adjustment in the trade deficit,
while remittance inflows are slowing down and flowing through informal cash channels.
Moreover, the restructuring of the debt will likely reduce outflows associated
with debt service over the coming 5 years.</p><p><b><u>Scenario
1 – Five-year debt service holiday on LBP TBs</u></b></p><p><b>A scenario limited to postponing
debt service on LBP denominated debt will keep Lebanon worse off for the
foreseeable future. </b>First, this approach does not deal with the debt stock
problem thus weighing on growth and the fiscal stance. Assuming fiscal
consolidation around 1.6% of GDP of primary surplus by 2025, this would leave
debt to GDP in 2025 at 225% of GDP, much higher than its current level (Figure
55). Second, Lebanon’s interest payments in foreign currency (averaging $3.5 bn
per year over the next 5 years) will worsen BDL’s net negative foreign currency
position and keep the public sector, the banking sector and BDL constrained, while
capital controls remain in place. Banks will also be under pressure as their
balance sheets remain impaired by higher NPLs and no interest on LBP government
debt. Under this scenario, we estimate that the impact on banks, and therefore required
recapitalization, will hover around $8bn (Figure 55).</p><div class="figdiv"><figure><figcaption>#55. Scenario 1 – Details: Debt service holiday on LBP TBs for 5 years*</figcaption><a data-footer="<p class=&#34;text-muted small&#34;>Source:

years + Cancellation of BDL’s LBP TBs portfolio</u></b></p><p><b>A proposed cancellation of the
BDL’s portfolio of LBP denominated government debt, in addition to the debt
service holiday for banks, will keep Lebanon in a debt trap for another decade.
</b>This scenario attempts to deal with part of the debt stock only, without addressing
the ability to service foreign currency liabilities given BDL’s net negative FX
position. Assuming fiscal consolidation at a slightly higher pace than in
scenario 1, reaching 2.2% of GDP of primary surplus by 2025, this would leave
debt to GDP in 2025 at 171% of GDP (Figure 56), above its current level. For
the same reasons highlighted in scenario 1, the public sector, the banking
sector and BDL will remain constrained and confidence in the system dented. The
required banking recapitalization will be as in scenario 1, i.e. around $8 bn. Moreover,
the implications for recapitalizing BDL following local debt restructuring are
likely to be inflationary and will need to be addressed through other policy
measures to limit its impact on the most vulnerable. In Figure 56 below, we
show the winners and losers amongst key stakeholders. We have highlighted in
red the changes compared to the previous scenario.</p><div class="figdiv"><figure><figcaption>#56. Scenario 2 – Details: 5-year Debt service holiday on LBP TBs for 5 years + BDL’s LBP TBs portfolio cancelled*</figcaption><a data-footer="<p class=&#34;text-muted small&#34;>Source:

portfolio + 50% Eurobond haircut</u></b></p><p><b>A
cancellation of BDL’s LBP debt portfolio and a 50% haircut on the Eurobonds will
not be enough to put the debt on a sustainable path.</b> Assuming fiscal
consolidation at a slightly higher pace than in scenarios 1 and 2, reaching
2.9% of GDP of primary surplus by 2025, this would leave debt to GDP in 2025 at
137% of GDP (Figure 57). Although the extent of initial debt stock reduction
under this scenario is significant (debt to GDP falls to 114% in year 1 post
restructuring), BDL’s net negative foreign currency position at $32 bn (post
50% haircut on Eurobonds) will render recapitalization of the banking sector
difficult (estimated at $13 bn). Investors will remain reluctant to invest in a
sector that is exposed to a central bank with a hugely encumbered balance sheet.
Low confidence in the currency and a medium to high risk of prolonged economic
contraction will weigh on the country’s fiscal position and its medium-term
debt sustainability prospects. We have highlighted in red the changes compared
to the previous scenario.</p><div class="figdiv"><figure><figcaption>#57. Scenario 3 – Details: BDL’s LBP TBs portfolio cancelled + 50% Eurobond haircut</figcaption><a data-footer="<p class=&#34;text-muted small&#34;>Source:

remain unsustainable if debt restructuring is limited to the stock of
government debt, without tackling BDL’s net FX position.</b> The latter will
continue to deteriorate as BDL’s foreign currency liabilities will increase
while its foreign assets dwindle as shown in Figure 51. In an environment where
private sector credit remains weak, and net claims on government are on the
rise as the BDL prints money to fund the fiscal deficit, persistent negative
net FX position at BDL has severe implications for the economy:</p><ul><li>Capital controls will persist for years to come
without an end in sight;</li><li>The exchange rate will remain under pressure as risks
of devaluation loom;</li><li>Economic activity will remain subdued while
inflationary pressures mount;</li><li>Banks’ exposure to BDL will limit ability to
fund and support growth;</li><li>External funding/support to revive the economy will
remain limited;</li><li>Loss of confidence due to high risk of recurring
crisis.</li></ul><p>As such, targeting fiscal and
external sustainability without addressing BDL’s net negative foreign currency position
as part of the debt restructuring is elusive. However, a comprehensive balance
sheet approach along the one suggested under Scenario 4 below may yield results
if properly implemented.</p><p><b><u>Scenario 4 – Dealing with BDL’s
balance sheet + 60-70% haircut on total debt (Eurobonds & TBs)</u></b></p><p><b>The objective of this scenario
is to bring Lebanon close to an investment grade rating targeting debt to GDP of
60-80% by 2030, and to rebuild BDL’s net foreign currency reserves to adequate
levels.</b> Assuming fiscal consolidation at a higher pace than in scenarios 1
to 3 reaching 3.8% of GDP of primary surplus by 2025, and growth to recover at
a faster pace than in scenarios 1-3 as a result of the gradual lifting of
capital controls and the pursuit of bold structural and fiscal reforms, debt to
GDP would be around 84% by 2030 if we limit the haircut to 60%. A haircut of
70% on total debt could bring debt to GDP to 63% by 2030 (Figure 58). This is a
dramatic and very deep debt restructuring that will need to be anchored within
a comprehensive, credible and internally consistent medium-term fiscal and
growth recovery plan. Without doing so and addressing BDL’s net FX position
(estimated to be around $33bn post debt restructuring), it would be difficult
to restore confidence in Lebanon’s currency and its financial sector. Below we
summarize the scenario and winners and losers amongst key stakeholders.</p><div class="figdiv"><div class="d-flex flex-wrap"><figure class="figure w-100"><figcaption>#58. Scenario 4 – Summary of range of outcomes</figcaption><a data-footer="<p class=&#34;text-muted small&#34;>Source:

the large $33bn negative net foreign currency position of BDL. </b>There are different
ways of tackling BDL’s negative FX position, with different implications for the
economy (inflation, pressure on currency, bank recapitalization …) and the
distribution of the losses among various stakeholders.</p><ul><li>One option is to <b>force convert $33 bn of
banks’ USD deposits at BDL</b> (i.e. around 40% of banks’ deposits in case of
70% haircut on debt) from USD to LBP at LBP1,508. This will have negative
implications on the exchange rate and inflation. Rebuilding BDL’s Net Foreign
Assets from a deeply negative position to zero will translate into a massive
increase in the money supply due to the proposed forced conversion at BDL level<sup><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[8]</a></sup>. We estimate
that the increase in the LBP monetary base under this scenario will be around
75%. The banks’ losses from the exposure to BDL could reach around $14 bn ($33
bn x the devaluation of the LBP – i.e. 42% if we assume the LBP at 2,600). The
cost of bank recapitalization (adding the debt and NPL impact) would thus vary
from $27 to $31bn (at 60 or 70% haircut), necessary to cover 8% of RWA.</li><li><b>Another option would be to apply a 40%
haircut on banks’ USD deposits and/or CDs at BDL equivalent to $33 bn. </b>While
thisoptioncould rebalance BDL’s FX position, it would increase
the losses for banks compared to the forced conversion discussed above, implying
higher recapitalization needs (estimated at $45-$49bn under scenario 4) and a
larger impact on depositors. This is the case given that forced conversion will
allow for preserving a residual value of the banks’ assets in LBP.</li><li><b>A third, but sub-optimal option, would be
for the government to issue $33 bn of new debt at lower interest rates (e.g.
2%).</b> This ideally should be done in tandem with the restructuring of the
Eurobonds but could bring the government’s foreign currency denominated debt to
$42 bn (around 100%-110% of GDP under a 70% haircut scenario to the Eurobonds).
The losses from the exposure to BDL for the Lebanese banking sector could reach
$11 bn. While this option reduces (but does not eliminate) the pain on
depositors, it does not tackle the core problem, namely Lebanon Inc’s net
foreign currency position (which we estimate would remain at negative $30 bn or
75% of GDP). Moreover, public debt would remain high (peaking at more than 150%
of GDP). Most importantly, the mix of debt will be heavily skewed towards
foreign currency denominated debt which makes it more difficult for the
government to reduce its debt burden over time. Simply put, trying to tackle a
structural solvency problem by issuing more debt does not help.</li></ul><p>For scenario 4 and the rest of
this section, we consider the first option of forced conversion as the base
case for tackling BDL’s negative FX position (Figure 60). We also assume that BDL’s
negative FX position is fully adjusted, something which could be debated if we
assume that a partial/gradual adjustment can take place if the BDL manages to
generate positive P&L results. Moreover, we recognize that one could assign
a certain (conservative) value to expected future privatisation proceeds and
reduce the BDL’s FX adjustment commensurately. In that case, the
remaining negative FX position of the BDL should not hinder confidence. This
will ensure that privatisation is done adequately, and fire sales are avoided.</p><div class="figdiv"><figure><figcaption>#60.

small depositors</h3><p><b>Given the scale of the expected
losses, debt restructuring should be accompanied by a strategy for banks’
recapitalization that helps protect small depositors. </b>The implications of
various debt restructuring scenarios presented above on the banks’ balance
sheets are significant with the recapitalisation requirements varying between $8
and $31 bn under a partial forced conversion of banks’ USD deposits/CDs at BDL,
or up to $49 bn under a partial haircut of banks’ USD deposits/CDs at BDL. The BDL
and the Banking Control Commission should establish a thorough assessment of
the impact of these scenarios and devise a strategy for restructuring the
banking sector with the objective of rebuilding a normal-sized banking sector
post debt restructuring and improving its governance given its importance in supporting
Lebanon’s growth recovery. This exercise should be part of the government’s
macroeconomic framework as it mulls various options for debt restructuring.</p><p><b>Capital increases would be
more effective if done after accounting for the impact of debt and BDL
liabilities restructuring on banks’ balance sheets</b>. This is crucial, particularly
that piecemeal ad-hoc measures for the past few months (e.g. capital increase,
forced “lirafication” of interest, lowering interest on deposits, capital withdrawals
at the official exchange rate as opposed to black market rate), resulted in
depositors’ absorbing the shock so far as opposed to shareholders’ equity. We
therefore stress the urgency to implement a comprehensive debt restructuring
anchored within a robust macroeconomic and fiscal policy framework. Otherwise
the size of the future required bail-in from depositors will only increase with
time if no action is pursued, and potentially hurt a larger number of
depositors in the lower brackets as discussed below.</p><p><b>Bank restructuring will become costlier as pressures on the
exchange rate intensify</b>. In our model, we
have assumed that the exchange rate adjusts to 2,600 in 2020 and beyond but
recognize that this may be a conservative estimate. The table 61 below
summarizes the impact of the currency devaluation on Lebanon Inc’s net foreign
currency position and on the recapitalization needs of the banking sector under
alternative exchange rates. The higher the currency devaluation, the higher the
recapitalization needs as the losses on the banks’ local currency assets will
be higher in USD terms<sup><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[9]</a></sup>.</p><div class="figdiv"><figure><figcaption>#61.

restructuring: Funding sources</u></p><p><b>Securing the funding for
recapitalizing the banks should follow “the waterfall of loss distribution” to
avoid hurting small depositors</b> (Figure 62 below). The latter is based on
the following key principle: Banks’ equity should absorb the losses first, and
depositors’ principal / savings should be the last to be impacted. Only when the
losses are too big to be absorbed by the banking sector’s existing equity
(estimated at ~$21 bn) and all sources of external capital have been exhausted
(existing shareholders, strategic investors, sale of banks assets, ….), then
depositors principal / savings can become a source of capital.</p><div class="figdiv"><figure><figcaption>#62. Banks’ restructuring: Funding sources (waterfall of losses)</figcaption><a data-footer="<p class=&#34;text-muted small&#34;>Source:

options should be explored in order to recapitalize a right-sized banking
sector able to support growth and preserve depositors’ savings. Some possible sources
of funding include:</p><ol type="1"><li><b>Internal revenue generation through lowering interests
on $ deposits</b> to 1.5-2.0% (from currently ~6.5%)<sup><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[10]</a></sup>. This can
effectively generate around $3.5 to $4.0 bn of internal capital over 2 years.</li><li><b>Recovered asset fund</b>: some proposal for establishing
an asset recovery fund and using its proceeds to protect depositors’ money
could also be envisaged.</li><li><b>Set up a bad bank funded by external investors</b>:
This would require a law. A more elaborate explanation is provided in “<a href="https://en.annahar.com/article/1144280-saving-the-lebanese-financial-sector-issues-and-recommendations">Saving
the Lebanese Financial sector: Issues and Recommendations</a>”</li><li><b>Large depositors’ bail-in</b> (deposit to equity
conversion by tranches of deposit size) could be envisaged in a voluntary or
mandatory way (if there is not enough voluntary subscription). Its key advantage
is that it provides ownership and optionality for long-term profits (equity upside).
This has been implemented in the past in Lebanon in a voluntary way (Intra
Bank) and during the banking crisis in Cyprus for example.</li><li><b>Partial forced conversion of deposits</b> should
be the option <b><u>of last resort</u></b>. To offset the losses driven by the
forced conversion of $33 bn USD deposits at BDL (as suggested under scenario
4), banks could force their depositors to partly convert their USD deposits to
LBP at an exchange rate of LBP1,508. This would be equivalent to ~27% of total
$ deposits. Assuming a ~72% LBP devaluation (LBP2,600 per $1), this translates
into a ~11% haircut on USD deposits. While the advantage of this approach is
that it provides immediate liquidity to depositors, it subjects them to an
immediate haircut on their deposits. This solution allows banks to avoid a
currency mismatch on their assets and liabilities, which is critical.</li></ol><p><b>Deposits concentration could render a potential solution easier and
politically more feasible.</b> Available data published in Al-Akhbar Newspaper
in June 2019 suggests there are 225k accounts between $100k and $1m and 25k
accounts above $1m (Figure 63). Combined, these represent ~8% of accounts in
the banking sector. As such, a government’s comprehensive plan for fiscal
reform, debt restructuring and bank recapitalization which aims to distribute
the losses in an equitable manner by targeting large depositors (e.g. >
$100k<sup><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[11]</a></sup>)
is not impossible or far-fetched. In fact, doing so could benefit the banks’
recapitalization:</p><ul><li>It provides credibility for the government in its willingness
and ability to protect small depositors;</li><li>It is akin to a wealth tax;</li><li>It targets those that benefited the most from high
interest rates over the last few years;</li><li>It limits social unrest following the proposed
restructuring and bank recapitalization;</li><li>It ensures that the banks’ proforma shareholder
base is not fragmented.</li></ul><div class="figdiv"><figure><figcaption>#63. Banks’ restructuring: Deposits are relatively concentrated</figcaption><a data-footer="<p class=&#34;text-muted small&#34;>Source:

recapitalization should be funded through existing shareholders, potential new
ones, donor funding, and if needed through a depositor’s bail in program where
the deposit to equity conversion is limited to 20-25% on USD deposits above
$100k. </b>As shown above, under scenarios 4A and 4B, the required funding to
recapitalize the banks up to an 8% capital adequacy ratio is around $27 to $31bn
if the haircut on the government debt reaches 60% to 70%. By applying the
waterfall of losses, we estimate a $4bn external capital injection is required
if we are to limit the deposit-to equity conversion for deposits above $100k to
20-25% under the bail-in program (Figure 64)<sup><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[12]</a></sup>.
The fresh capital injection could be achieved through various ways, including
(i) raising capital from existing shareholders or strategic investors, (ii) the
sale of banks assets (e.g. foreign assets, real estate), and (iii) revaluation
of banks assets (e.g. real estate). In addition, we assume that $4 bn could be
gained from lowering interest on USD deposits (from currently 6.5% to 2%). As a
matter of fact, the more robust and credible the debt/BDL liabilities
restructuring and bank recapitalization plans are, the higher the probability
of attracting external financing to the sector and the less burden on
depositors. In this regard, it is important to highlight that recommendations
to dispose of public asset or create a fund to fund recapitalization of BDL and
banks are not advisable given the weak governance environment in Lebanon. Such
proposals in our view risk deepening state capture and would go against the
principle of equitable burden sharing to which this paper adheres.</p><p><b>Finally, it would be possible to differentiate among targeted
depositors to render the bail-in program more equitable and achieve other
economic objectives.</b> There is a possibility to go more granular in setting
rules for bail-in deposits. Devising rules to consolidate the equity of the
process and serving other economic policy objectives may be considered,
including targeting accrued interest first (e.g. since 2015), and differentiating
accounts based on the nature of their economic activity: (e.g. exempting
offshore FX generating nature of account, large employers ….). Moreover, and in
order to ensure a fair treatment of depositors, future banks’ profits could be
restricted and assigned by order of priority as follows:</p><ul><li>Increase banks’ capital until it reaches a certain
required capital ratio (e.g. 15%);</li><li>Repay the principal loss due to the forced
conversion of USD deposits to LBP;</li><li>Compensate depositors that participated in the
bail-in for any effective loss.</li></ul><p>Having said
that,a blanket rule and threshold for applying the deposit to equity
conversion could be easier and more transparent to administer, reducing risks of
abuse and corruption. As the debate about loss distribution and burden sharing
matures further, it is extremely important to mitigate the risk and adopt a
clear evidence-based communication strategy to explain the rationale, benefits
and costs of a bail-in scheme.</p><div class="figdiv"><figure><figcaption>#64. Banks’ restructuring: Example of funding sources* (based on deposit distribution in #63)</figcaption><a data-footer="<p class=&#34;text-muted small&#34;>Source:

opposed to a deposit-to-equity bail in) could Lebanon Inc’s net foreign currency
position move into positive territory as shown in (Figure 66) below. This would

fiscal adjustment program</h3><p><b>The proposed restructuring of the public debt and BDL’s
liabilities, while recapitalizing the banking sector will need to be anchored
within a medium-term macro-fiscal plan that supports social equity and growth</b>. The absence of budgets between 2008 and 2017 severely
weakened fiscal institutions, undermined the quality of fiscal policy
formulation and sound public financial management. Since 2017, successive
governments proved unable and/or unwilling to develop a new vision for economic
growth away from the current unsustainable rentier model or rethink a new
social contract that reduces excessive inequality in wealth distribution. The imperative
for restructuring posed by the crisis is thus an opportunity to gear fiscal
policy towards that direction.</p><p><b>Fiscal consolidation
should be a cornerstone of the plan and target a realistic, politically
feasible primary surplus</b>. This paper
does not delve into the details of the fiscal policy measures that should be
included in any prospective plan. It is rather based on various analysis and
studies that multiple stakeholders have been advocating for. We recognize
however that front-loaded and aggressive fiscal austerity measures may not be
politically feasible immediately. As such, in scenario 4, we targeted a primary
surplus of 3.5% of GDP on average per year over the next 10 years (~1% on
average in the first 5 years, and increasing afterwards), a difficult but not
unrealistic objective if the set of policy measures is credible and consistent
with the <u>principles of equitable burden sharing and good governance</u>.</p><ul><li><b><i>On the
revenue side</i></b>, the government should
aim to gradually raise revenues to GDP from its 20.5% of GDP at end 2018 to 22%
in 2025 and 24% in 2030, following a revenue collapse in 2020. The crisis
offers the opportunity to reform Lebanon’s tax regime in a way that is more
equitable and supportive of high-quality growth and productive private
investment. New measures include penalties and taxes on investments in marine
properties, higher taxes on property and reforms to the pension system in a way
to increase coverage, and curbing tax evasion and corruption</li><li><b><i>On the expenditure
side</i></b>, it would be extremely
difficult to significantly cut primary spending. Lebanon’s primary expenditures
averaged 21.2% over the past ten years, compared to 26.6% in Emerging Markets.
As shown in Figure 8 above, the rigidity of the budget leaves limited room for
manoeuvre in the short term, and requires an immediate focus on key elements:</li><ol type="a"><li><b>Lowering EDL deficit</b>: We assume the government will undertake all necessary
measures (raising tariffs, reduction of technical and non-technical losses, institutional
reforms, switching to gas…) to reduce transfers from their current level of 3%
of GDP to 0 by 2025-2027.</li><li><b>Resizing the public sector </b>based on functional review of ministries and state-owned
enterprises: While this may prove difficult in the short run, possible
measures could include hiring freezes, elimination of vacant positions,
reduction of excesses in administrative and operational costs and a reform of
state owns entities (SOEs).</li><li><b>Reforming the social security
benefit system</b> in the public sector by accelerating
pension reforms and increasing the contribution rate of public sector
employees.</li><li><b>Reducing the debt service </b>payments through a deep restructuring of the public debt
as discussed above. This should help bring down the interest payment to GDP to
around 5% of GDP, down from 10-11% at present.</li><li><b>Expanding
social safety nets</b> towards ~1.5% of GDP per year over next 5 years.</li><li><b>Increasing
the capital expenditures</b> and directing it towards supporting a new economic
growth model (smart infrastructure, environment related…), while improving its
efficiency through public procurement and public investment management reforms.</li></ol></ul><p>In our model, we have assumed that savings resulting from
EDL and other reforms are reallocated towards expanding and protecting social
spending, while ensuring it is better targeted to support the most vulnerable
and mitigate the impact of the crisis on the poor and the middle class.</p><h3 id="toc10">F- Mitigating the cost of the adjustment
on the most vulnerable</h3><p><b>According to the World Bank, estimates
indicate that around 37% of the Lebanese resident population lived in poverty
in 2019, up from 25.6 percent in 2011-2012</b>.
In a recent statement, its Lebanon Country Director said that “what’s coming
can be worse if not addressed immediately”, highlighting that “poverty could
rise to 50% if the economic situation worsens; and that unemployment,
especially among youth, is already high and could further rise sharply”.
Indeed, international experience suggests that the major threats to the more
vulnerable segments of society (notably the poor and the middle class) during a
financial crisis are caused by a sharp contraction in economic activity and
rising unemployment. Figures 68 and 69 portrays the extent of deterioration
expected in 2020: almost 45% of Lebanese will fall below the poverty line
(Figure 68) while 22% will below the extreme poverty line (Figure 69).</p><div class="figdiv"><div class="d-flex flex-lg-nowrap flex-xl-nowrap flex-wrap"><figure class="figure w-100"><figcaption># 68.

and mitigate the large expected negative effects of the required adjustments.</b> Social protection schemes in Lebanon are very thin and
are being eroded by the impact of a depreciating LBP and rising inflation. According
to the World Bank, only 10% of the population over age 60 receives any type of
pension, leaving the most elderly reliant on family support, remittances or
other types of informal care. Lebanon should therefore avoid mistakes done
elsewhere and ensure that fiscal austerity does not come at the expense of the
necessary spending on properly targeted social safety nets. We have thus made
sure, in our model forecasts shown above, that the government ringfences social
protection spending to the tune of 1.5% of GDP per year in order to better
manage political backlash and social tensions, enhance equity through
redistributive policies while building legitimacy and credibility.</p><p><b>Mitigation measures
should in our view be all encompassing with support from the international
community</b>. This paper cannot delve into
the details of the social mitigation measures, but believes the government
should work closely with donors, and notably the World Bank in order to
implement and ensure funding for key social programs such as:</p><ul><li>Expand the existing National Poverty Targeting Program
and its related food voucher program;</li><li>Protect spending on education and health while improving
efficiency, including education grants/cash transfers to reduce dropouts and expand
pro-poor universal health coverage;</li><li>Accelerate pension reforms to ensure fiscal and social
sustainability of National Social Security Fund;</li><li>Devise a youth employment grant scheme if funding
permits.</li></ul><h3 id="toc11">G- Establishing a credible exchange rate and monetary policy</h3><p><b>Managing the exchange rate in a way to
facilitate the adjustment of external (trade/current account) imbalances should
be a core element of the macro-fiscal framework.</b>The timing/sequencing
and magnitude of the exchange rate adjustment will depend on the credibility of
accompanying macroeconomic and fiscal policies and the availability of external
funding. Given Lebanon’s large negative Net
Foreign Asset (NFA) position and the resulting LBP overvaluation, an exchange
rate adjustment is inevitable, especially that Lebanon’s current account deficit
will likely remain large around 10% of GDP in the short to medium-term. The
objective is to make it happen in an orderly fashion by ensuring that the fiscal, debt restructuring and bank recapitalization plan
is conducive to closing BDL’s net negative foreign currency position, and
supports the gradual build-up of net reserves with the help of external donor
funding, ideally in the context of a comprehensive program with IMF oversight. The
BDL should also devise a credible monetary policy framework and deploy its
various liquidity and exchange rate management tools. Without these measures,
the risk of the exchange rate overshooting and causing a spiralling
hyperinflation becomes very high.</p><p><b>In parallel, proactive
trade policy measures should support the external adjustment effort</b>. The government should take proactive measures to reduce
Lebanon’s import bill by opening a dialogue with the private sector on the one
hand, and its trading partners on the other. Most trade agreements signed by
Lebanon, and notably those with its main trading partners (EU countries), have
clauses that could be used in the case of a BoP crisis. The Ministry of Economy
and Trade should mobilize its trade negotiations teams towards that goal in

ministries of Industry and Agriculture.</p><h3 id="toc12">H- Boosting private sector growth</h3><p><b>The sustainability of any crisis response will depend on its
ability to reverse Lebanon’s economic growth contraction and putting people
back to work</b>. Accordingly, policy measures and initiatives to boost growth
should constitute a key element of the policy framework which this paper will
not delve into. Having said that, such initiatives should be geared to achieve
two objectives:</p><ol type="1"><li><b><i>Growth enhancing structural reforms</i></b>,
including legal and regulatory measures aimed at improving the business
environment, improving competitiveness, upgrading the bankruptcy and insolvency
law and framework…etc.</li><li><b><i>Investment growth stimulus </i></b>aimed at
upgrading and expanding the economic and social infrastructure to support
private sector activity. Ideally, this should be part of a rethinking of the
CEDRE framework, and the review of the priorities proposed in the Capital
Investment Plan following the implementation of key structural reforms, and
notably the establishment of regulatory authorities in key sectors, the
enactment of a new procurement law and the implementation of the Public
Investment Management Assessment recommendations.</li></ol><div><table class="table table-responsive-lg table-bordered text-center"><caption>#70. Key

scale and complexity of the Lebanese multi-dimensional crisis is extremely
acute and requires immediate action given the exorbitant actual and future cost
of reform delays and ad-hoc piece-meal policy decisions. Measures to stop the
bleeding of FX reserves should take precedence first, including the
establishment of a solid legal and regulatory basis for non-discretionary and
transparent capital controls; and a strategic management of BDL’s remaining FX
reserves.</p><p>In parallel, a solid, well-structured
and coordinated policy and institutional framework to develop and implement a
credible debt restructuring and growth recovery plan is a must. The only path
to sustainable debt is laid out in Scenario 4, requiring a deep reduction in
debt (60-70% haircut) and encompassing the foreign currency liabilities of the
BDL. Such a restructuring should be accompanied by a robust framework for bank
insolvency and plan for banking sector recapitalization to the tune of
$25-30bn. We believe this is doable in a way that allows for an equitable
burden sharing of the losses through a bail in program targeting large
depositors (>100k), while protecting small depositors.</p><p>Importantly, the plan should be
anchored within a robust and credible medium-term fiscal and growth recovery framework
which aims at improving the composition of spending, raising revenues while
improving wealth distribution, and rebuilding the stock of BDL’s net reserves
in line with the standards of reserve adequacy. The plan should be also underpinned
by strong commitment to public sector and public financial management and
procurement reforms. The political viability of a fiscal consolidation plan
would be dented if not accompanied by an acceleration of structural reform
measures aimed at raising productivity, improving competitiveness, and tackling
corruption.</p><p>Given
the large funding needs, an IMF program supported by donors to the tune of $30
bn at least over the coming three years is thus necessary. A CEDRE 2.0 framework
and financing package taking into consideration
Lebanon’s new macroeconomic realities and societal aspirations for overhauling its
economic and financial sector model could be the anchor.</p><hr><div class="small"><p><sup><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[1]</a></sup>
Non-Resident deposits are accounted for as external debt by the IMF</p><p><sup><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6">[2]</a></sup>
For example, for each new deposit at BDL in USD,
a bank would earn a 6.5% interest in USD and in addition have an opportunity to
borrow a slightly larger amount in LBP at 2% and re-deposit it at BDL at 10.5%
for 10 years</p><p><sup><a href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7">[3]</a></sup> There are conflicting views among policymakers in
Lebanon about the validity of the $31 bn stock of gross FX reserves, which we
are unable to ascertain, including a claim that BDL may have lent Lebanese
banks more than $7bn of them implying Lebanon Inc could have a worse net
negative foreign currency position.</p><p><sup><a href="#_ftnref8" name="_ftn8">[4]</a></sup> We think the above annual drain of FX may be bigger as
banks and BDL may have contractual obligations which are not publicly reported (e.g.
repo).</p><p><sup><a href="#_ftnref9" name="_ftn9">[5]</a></sup> Some
of the analysis in this paper fed into <a href="https://en.annahar.com/article/1098925-lebanons-economic-crisis-a-ten-point-action-plan-for-avoiding-a-lost-decade">Lebanon's
Economic Crisis: A Ten Point Action Plan for Avoiding a Lost Decade</a></p><p><sup><a href="#_ftnref10" name="_ftn10">[6]</a></sup> It is important to observe if the increase in NPLs
will be linear over several years (e.g. 30% over 5 years = 6% per annum) or
exponential (e.g. 30% over 2 years = 15% per annum). In the former scenario,
the initial recapitalization of the banks can potentially be limited to a
couple of years of losses as outer years losses can be absorbed by the internal
capital generated by the banks (i.e. their profits).</p><p><sup><a href="#_ftnref11" name="_ftn11">[7]</a></sup>
Pension related payments need to be addressed as
the pension system finances are on an unsustainable path.</p><p><sup><a href="#_ftnref12" name="_ftn12">[8]</a></sup> Other elements that have negative implications on the
LBP include: BDL’s continued fiscal deficit monetization and financial
engineering operations (an estimated 8% return in LBP on $50bn of loans
provided by BDL to the banks and which could represent 8% to 10% of GDP in
2020). We estimated that these two elements combined increase the LBP money
supply by approximately 20% per annum.</p><p><sup><a href="#_ftnref13" name="_ftn13">[9]</a></sup> Assuming we are looking at the balance sheet in USD
terms. The result would be the same if we look at the balance sheet in LBP
terms: the higher the currency devaluation, the higher the recapitalization
needs as the value of the foreign currency liabilities (mainly USD deposits) on
banks’ balance sheet will increase (in local currency terms).</p><p><sup><a href="#_ftnref14" name="_ftn14">[10]</a></sup> Some changes
may have occurred on the interest rate levels which may not be fully captured.</p><p><sup><a href="#_ftnref15" name="_ftn15">[11]</a></sup> We used
publicly available data providing deposit distribution below $100k, between
100K and $ 1M and then above that amount. The government should ideally use a
higher threshold than 100k.</p><p><sup><a href="#_ftnref16" name="_ftn16">[12]</a></sup>
Lack of availability of detailed distribution of deposits by tranches before
the study did not allow us to explore various options/scenarios for possible
bail-in formulas with higher threshold than $100k.</p></div></div><script crossorigin="anonymous" integrity="sha384-J6qa4849blE2+poT4WnyKhv5vZF5SrPo0iEjwBvKU7imGFAV0wwj1yYfoRSJoZ+n" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.slim.min.js"></script><script crossorigin="anonymous" integrity="sha384-Q6E9RHvbIyZFJoft+2mJbHaEWldlvI9IOYy5n3zV9zzTtmI3UksdQRVvoxMfooAo" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.16.0/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script><script crossorigin="anonymous" integrity="sha384-wfSDF2E50Y2D1uUdj0O3uMBJnjuUD4Ih7YwaYd1iqfktj0Uod8GCExl3Og8ifwB6" src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script crossorigin="anonymous" integrity="sha256-Y1rRlwTzT5K5hhCBfAFWABD4cU13QGuRN6P5apfWzVs=" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ekko-lightbox/5.3.0/ekko-lightbox.min.js"></script><script>$(document).on('click','[data-toggle="lightbox"]',function(event){event.preventDefault();$(this).ekkoLightbox({alwaysShowClose:true});});</script></body></html>
